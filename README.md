### Hi there, I'm Lily! 👋

I'm a developer diving into the new frontier of software engineering in the age of AI. 🤖✨

My mission is to explore, build, and understand how modern AI tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally changing how we create software. This profile serves as my digital notebook and project portfolio as I share what I learn.

### 🚀 What I'm Exploring

My current focus is on building full-stack, "AI-native" applications. This means understanding everything from the core agentic logic to the final user interface.

* **Agent Orchestration:** Building multi-agent workflows with the **OpenAI Agent SDK (Assistants API)** to create autonomous systems that can reason, delegate tasks, and use tools.
* **Database Interaction:** Using **Vanna.ai** to create specialized agents that can safely and accurately translate natural language questions into SQL queries, turning chat into a powerful BI tool.
* **Conversational UI:** Leveraging **ChatKit** to build polished, production-ready chat interfaces, handling all the complexities of streaming, attachments, and state management right out of the box.

### 🌱 My Current Projects

I'm currently designing and building a "Text-to-SQL" chat application. The goal is to combine these cutting-edge tools into a single, seamless experience:

1.  **Frontend:** Use **ChatKit** as the drop-in user interface.
2.  **Backend Agent:** Use the **OpenAI Agent SDK** to manage the conversation and orchestrate tasks.
3.  **Specialized Tool:** When the user asks a question about data, the main agent will hand off the request to a specialized agent powered by **Vanna.ai**, which will:
    * Generate a safe SQL query based on its training.
    * Run the query against a database.
    * Return the natural language answer to the main agent, which then streams it to the user via ChatKit.

I'm documenting my journey and I'm always open to chatting, sharing ideas, or collaborating on a project.
